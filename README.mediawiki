= About Whonix =
[[Image:https://raw.github.com/adrelanos/testw/master/whonix.jpg|Whonix Concept]]

Whonix (called TorBOX in past) is an anonymous general purpose operating system based on Virtual Box, Debian GNU/Linux and Tor. By Whonix design, IP and
DNS leaks are impossible. Not even malware with root rights can find out the user's real IP/location.

This is because Whonix consists of two (virtual) machines. One machine solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other machine, which we call Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only connections through Tor are possible.

The project homepage with a full project description, threat model, design and documentation, build instructions can be found here:
https://www.whonix.org

Whonix is produced independently from the Tor (r) anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.

See LICENSE in root of Whonix source for copyright, license and authors.

The Build Documentation is only interesting for developers and people who want to build Whonix from source code. If you're a user you may want to head over to the [https://www.whonix.org Whonix Homepage].

Looking for developers! Patches and new developers highly welcome!

= Build Documentation =
== Introduction ==
This page documents how to build Whonix Virtual Box images. If you have any questions or need help, get in Contact.

It documents how to build the ''development version'' of Whonix. If you are rather interested to build the stable version of Whonix, click [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation here].

Knowledge assumed: Virtualization basic principles; operation of your platform; Linux knowledge: how to install Debian and basic command line knowledge.

Only one prerequisites: you need a working internet connection.

For discussion related to the development and build process of Whonix images get
in contact.

How to use the resulting images, is documented in the [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Documentation/ Documentation].

== Warning ==
''/dev/mapper/loop0p1'' (and ''/dev/nbd0'') (used for mounting the images) is hard coded inside Whonix build scripts. Beware if you are using such devices. It may conflict with TrueCrypt. (And possibly other tools relying on
''/dev/mapper/loop0p1'' (and ''/dev/nbd0'').)

To avoid damage to your host system, it may be wise to build Whonix inside a Virtual Machine.

== Build Anonymity ==
While downloading the required tools for building Whonix your internet service provider could if he want notice that you want to build Whonix. This is especially interesting, if you want to redistribute Whonix, but still want to stay anonymous. The full story can be read in the chapter [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Build Anonymity/ Build Anonymity].

== Build Security ==
Especially, but not exclusively, if you want to distribute Whonix images, you should improve the security of your build environment.

* Build on a dedicated build system, install security updates... ([https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Security Guide/ Security Guide])
* All install media and all downloaded/used code must be verified (including all software on the host).
* Hashes, fingerprints in the scripts and the wiki is not to be trusted. Verify everything.
* Read [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Trust/ Trust].

== Host preparation ==
It is recommend to set your terminal (for example Konsole) to unlimited scrollback, so you can watch the full build log.

You need to build on '''Debian'''. ((How to obtain Debian safely: [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Debian/ Debian ISO gpg verification]))

The build scripts could be adapted to run on other *NIX systems as well but currently they assume apt-get and grml-debootstrap to be available. You need about 15 GB of free space.

((Build dependencies and configurations get automatically applied by ''[https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/10_prepare-build-machine build-steps.d/10_prepare-build-machine]'', so you don't have to worry about that.))

== Introduction into Whonix Source Code ==
This chapter is dedicated to give an introduction into the Whonix source code. '''If you prefer to read and understand the source code just by reading scripts you may skip this optional chapter.''' When you like to mess with the source code, it would probable help a lot if you at least knew what '''.img''', '''.vdi''', '''.vmdk''' and '''.ova''' are being used for. See [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Source_Code_Intro Source Code Introduction].

== Get the Whonix Source Code ==
Install git.

<pre>
sudo apt-get install git
</pre>

Get the Whonix source code.

<pre>git clone https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix</pre>

== Get adrelanos's PGP Public Key ==

This chapter is recommend for better security, but not strictly required. ((See [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Trust/ Trust].))

Get into Whonix source folder.

<pre>
cd Whonix
</pre>

Import the key.

<pre>
gpg --import adrelanos.asc
</pre>

Verify.

<pre>
gpg --fingerprint 9B157153925C303A42253AFB9C131AD3713AAEEF
</pre>

Should show.

<pre>
pub   4096R/713AAEEF 2012-03-02
      Key fingerprint = 9B15 7153 925C 303A 4225  3AFB 9C13 1AD3 713A AEEF
uid                  adrelanos <adrelanos at riseup dot net>
sub   4096R/794279C4 2012-03-02
</pre>

For even better security, [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Trusting Whonix Signing Key/ learn about Whonix signing key].

== Verify the Whonix Souce Code ==

This chapter is recommend for better security, but not strictly required. ((See [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Trust/ Trust].))

Get a list of available git tags.

<pre>git tag</pre>

Verify the tag you want to build.

<pre>
... Replace with tag you want to build.
git tag -v 0.6.1
</pre>

Output should look similar to this.

<pre>
object 13870efc29018065267788f9f23026e6ff489684
type commit
tag 0.6.1
tagger adrelanos <adrelanos at riseup dot net> 1348681401 -0400

0.6.1
gpg: Signature made Wed Sep 26 17:43:26 2012 UTC using RSA key ID 713AAEEF
gpg: Good signature from "adrelanos <adrelanos at riseup dot net"
</pre>

The warning.

<pre>
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
</pre>

Is explained on the
[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Trusting Whonix Signing Key/ Whonix signing
key] page and can be ignored.

== Create the Images ==
=== Preparations ===

(1) Git checkout, which version or [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev_git/ git branch] you want to build.

<pre>
... 0.6.1
git checkout 0.6.1

... For stable including hotfixes.
... (If there is no git tag yet.)
git checkout stable

... In case you want to use the development branch.
git checkout master
</pre>

(2) Make sure there aren't any VMs in Virtual Box already called Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation - any VMs with such a name get deleted!

(3) Check if the [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev_SourceCodeIntro/#gpg-keys gpg public keys] are still up to date.
If you are in luck, you never have to update the keys yourself and the Whonix maintainer will keep them updated.

=== VM Creation ===
Open a shell and type:

<pre>
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build_all
</pre>

Check if all went ok.

Please report back any issues!

== Debugging ==

'''OPTIONAL''' (Only in case something goes wrong or if you want to audit or develop Whonix.)

See [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Source_Code_Intro#Debugging Debugging].

== Final Steps ==

'''Only Required For Redistribution.''' See
[https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Redistribution Dev/Redistribution].
