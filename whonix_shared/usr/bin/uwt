## May be distributed under the same terms as Tor itself

## Note:
## -v (verbose) and the UWT_VERBOSE environment variable set to 1
## will break many graphical applications, which use applications,
## which will call applications, which we wrapped to use uwt.

## You can also type in shell:
## 	export UWT_VERBOSE="1"
## to enable verbose output.

## UWT_DEV_PASSTHROUGH is only supported in Whonix.
## Only supposed to be used by developers.
## Torsocks will not be used.
## Traffic will be send in the clear.
## Thus, if behind a transparent proxy, traffic will go through that transparent proxy.
## Just as uwt would not be used.
## This is useful for development and building Whonix.
#	export UWT_DEV_PASSTHROUGH="1"

## Note:
## When running applications as root, you also have to set and
## export that variable as root.
