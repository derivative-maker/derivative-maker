So Tor should now be disabled.

whonixsetup really only deactivates Tor by commenting in "DisableNetwork 1" in /etc/tor/torrc.
Running it multiple times in a row archives nothing.
In case of network problems, this is probably not the cause.
You can confirm that by manually checking if "DisableNetwork 1" has been commented in /etc/tor/torrc.
