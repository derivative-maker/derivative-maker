## Whonix News ##
*2012-09-10*
Whonix **ALPHA** version **0.4.5** has been released and is ready for testing. Many usability bugs have been fixed. Security was further and slightly improved. Since it's an alpha version, there can be further unknown bugs. Known bugs are on the [Download] page. Changelog: [Changelog] Release announcement: [tor-talk Mailing List](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-October/025921.html); [Debian Derivatives Mailing List](http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2012/10/msg00007.html); [Whonix Devel Mailing List](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=whonix-devel)

*2012-28-09*
Whonix **ALPHA** version **0.4.4** has been released and is ready for testing. There some usability bugs inside, but workarounds are available in this readme. Since it's an alpha version, there can be further unknown bugs.

I did not want to delay this release any further. The mess with multiple project names and websites had to come to an end. I've seen people loosing interest in open source projects, because there was no visible progress. This is no vaporware.

Changelog: [Changelog]

## Old News ##
See [OldNews] for news about Whonix prior 0.3.0.

# Checklist #
## On the host ##
### Tor Browser Bundle ###
It is recommend to always have the latest working [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) installed on your host. A great way to learn the basics about Tor.

The Tor Browser Bundle is great for testing if you live in a censored area or not, if Tor is blocked by your ISP or not. When you need (private) (obfuscated) bridges for the Tor Browser Bundle, you will need them for Whonix as well. (See [bridges]([Bridges support](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/OptionalConfigurations/#using-private-obfuscated-bridges),)

If you can not get the Tor Browser Bundle to work, you will most certainly not get Whonix to work either.


### General ###
We recommend you use a **dedicated OS installation** just for hosting the Whonix VMs, see [Security](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Security/). Always install the latest **security updates**. Keep your system secure, install security software, use a **screen lock** if you leave the computer, **encrypt all hard drives **, **wipe RAM** on shutdown (e.g. using a kexec script) - or do not leave the computer unattended immediately after shutdown.

### Network Time Syncing ###
If you were a of TorBOX 0.2.1 or below and removed NTP, restore it now.

        sudo apt-get install ntpd

Virtual Box has a feature to spoof the initial virtual hardware clock offset by setting the clock X milliseconds in feature or past.
Syntax:

	VBoxManage modifyvm <name> --biossystemtimeoffset -<milliseconds>
	VBoxManage modifyvm <name> --biossystemtimeoffset +<milliseconds>

It's prudent to add a random delay within the following range.

	VBoxManage modifyvm <name> --biossystemtimeoffset -60000
	VBoxManage modifyvm <name> --biossystemtimeoffset +60000

Pick one example per VM and use random values within the range. (On the host.)

	VBoxManage modifyvm "Whonix-Gateway" --biossystemtimeoffset -35017
	VBoxManage modifyvm "Whonix-Gateway" --biossystemtimeoffset +27931

	VBoxManage modifyvm "Whonix-Workstation" --biossystemtimeoffset -35017
	VBoxManage modifyvm "Whonix-Workstation" --biossystemtimeoffset +27931

Summary:

* Needs to be done only after importing the Virtual Machine: Modify --biossystemtimeoffset for all Virtual Machines.
* Run Secure Network Time Synchronization after suspend and resume or do not use suspend/resume at all.

Even though it's a difficult topic, you are advised to read [Whonix's Secure And Distributed Time Synchronization Mechanism](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Security/#whonixs-secure-and-distributed-time-synchronization-mechanism).

## On Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation ##
### Change Passwords ###
If using a distributed image with a **default password** immediately change it: In a terminal type: 

Login as root:

    sudo su

Change root and user password:

    passwd
    passwd user

and follow the instructions. The default password is "changeme".

### Security Updates ###
Regularly check for **security updates** and apply them with:

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

### Known bugs ###
Check [Download](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Download/) page for a list of known bugs.

## On Whonix-Gateway ##
To change the **keyboard layout** in Whonix-Gateway:

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-data

    ## French keyboards:
    ## Perhaps an upstream bug.
    ## ( http://free.nchc.org.tw/clonezilla-live/stable/Known-issues-Clonezilla-live.txt )
    ## If you are using French Keymap, Remember to use "Select keymap from full list"
    ## 1. Select keymap from full list
    ## 2. pc / azerty / French / Same as X11 (latin 9) /Standard

    ## Does not work in Debian for some reason.
    #sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration

To **shut down** the gateway simply enter

    sudo poweroff
    
## On Whonix-Workstation ##
### Single vs Double Click ###
KDE uses single click instead of double click by default. If you want to change that to double click:

    KDE -> Start menu button -> Applications -> Settings -> System Settings ->
    input devices -> mouse -> double click -> apply - Done.

### Change keyboard layout ###
If you want to change the **keyboard layout** from the default "us" to something else:

    KDE -> Start menu button -> Applications -> Settings -> System Settings ->
    input devices -> layout -> add yours and remove default one -> apply -> Done.

Or:

    Start menu button -> search -> keyboard -> layout -> add yours and remove default one

### Visit check.tpo ###
**Verify** you are connected to Tor: https://check.torproject.org 

### Clock info ###
To prevent against time zone leaks, the clock was set to UTC. Do not change!

# Tor Browser #
A future update of Tor Button might break Tor Browser running in Whonix-Workstation, since the update resets the network settings. If that happens, update Tor Browser.

**Update the Tor Browser**. There is no auto-update feature for Tor Browser, manually update. Regularly check https://blog.torproject.org for news!

Tor Browser version check and update (after confirmation) in Whonix can be done with:

    torbrowser -update

In case Tor Browser inside Whonix-Workstation breaks, a news with instructions on how to fix the issue will be posted within a few days. If not, the Whonix developer is not aware of the issue.

# XChat / IRC #
XChat has been hardened according to [TorifyHOWTO/XChat](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat). All servers, beside the secure (SSL) version of OFTC have been removed. You are encouraged to add the secure version of your IRC server. (Preferably a hidden service, SSL as a fallback or at best, both.) See also [TorifyHOWTO/XChat](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat).

On OFTC is the official #Tor. Note, that no Whonix developers hang out there! Upstream Tor developers do not support Whonix. For contacting Whonix developers, see Questions / Discussion section in this Readme.

## Reset your XChat idenity ##
If you want to reset your XChat identity, run *xchat-reset*. WARNING: this will kill XChat, delete all your settings, scripts and logs and creates a fresh XChat identity.

    xchat-reset

## SASL ##
Some networks, some hidden IRC servers, such as freenode, require SASL to connect to them.

All XChat plugins have been deactivated (hardening) and moved to /usr/lib/xchat/plugins.disabled. If you really need a plugin, such as perl for SASL, you can use the example below.

    sudo mv /usr/lib/xchat/plugins.disabled/perl.so /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/

Setting up SASL is outside the scope of this document, have a look into [TorifyHOWTO/XChat](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat).

# Tor Controller / Vidalia / Arm #
Since Whonix does not include Vidalia, we recommend Arm. It's already preinstalled on Whonix 0.2.1 and above. Simply type on Whonix-Gateway:

    sudo arm

# Whonix is based on Debian, VirtualBox and Tor #
Remember, Whonix is based on Debian, VirtualBox and Tor. It is nothing very special.

No stripped down versions are used. For example, anything ^1^ you can do with Debian GNU/Linux, you can do with Whonix as well. Most Debian GNU/Linux problems and questions with Whonix you may have can probable be solved the same way as for "vanilla" Debian. Q: "How do I install xrandr on Debian GNU/Linux?" A: "The same way you would with regular Debian GNU/Linux. Might help to *apt-get install command-not-found*. Try *apt-get install xrandr*. It well tell which package is missing. Nothing special. Same goes for Tor etc. Whonix doesn't break anything, it doesn't stop you from using [obfuscated bridges](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/OptionalConfigurations/#using-bridges) or any other fancy stuff etc.

Tip: since Ubuntu is based on Debian, most things working on Ubuntu will also work on Debian. Most online help for Ubuntu also works for Debian.

^1^ Actually only "almost" everything. Any limitations (beside bugs) will be Tor's responsibility. For example, UDP is not supported by Tor yet, therefore this won't work.
</font>

# Use full-screen #
It's advised to work in full-screen. This feature is also inherited from Virtual Box. Press your host key ^2^ and press F. That will activate full-screen. You end up with Whonix (and Debian) default resolution and color depth 1024x768x24. ^1^

<font size="-3">
,,
^1^ As per [Whonix's Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Security/#whonixs-protocol-leak-protection-and-fingerprinting-protection).
^2^ Virtual Box -> Global Settings -> Input -> Host Key. You can also see the current Host Key in the bottom right corner of Virtual Box.
</font>

# Virtual Consoles #
This feature is inherited from Debian GNU/Linux and Virtual Box. It's noted in Readme because not many people are aware of it. The Debian (not Whonix) feature is to press alt + crtl + F1 or F2, F3, etc. for additional text consoles or F7 for graphical console. Because Debian already registered alt + ctrl keys. Instant of alt + ctrl, use the Virtual Box Host Key. (^2^ above) That means, use Host Key + F1, F2, F7, etc. to do the same inside Virtual Box.

# Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit #
For information about metadata please read the [MAT](https://mat.boum.org/) website. It is pre-installed on Whonix. (The Debian *mat* package has been installed.)

Some information about metadata is in chapter [Whonix's Protocol-Leak-Protection and Fingerprinting-Protection](https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Security/#whonixs-protocol-leak-protection-and-fingerprinting-protection).

Start graphical user interface from start menu:

    Start menu button -> Applications -> Utilities -> Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit

Or the command line interface:

    mat
    # or for gui
    mat-gui
